#SUBJECT: System Programming &Operating System Lab


#Group A Based on system programming
1. Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a  two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine in Java using
object oriented feature. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and few assembler
directives.


2. Implement Pass-II of two pass assembler for pseudo-machine in Java using object oriented features. The 
output of assignment-1 (intermediate file and symbol table) should be input for this assignment.


3. Design suitable data structures and implement pass-I of a two-pass macro-processor using OOP features in Java


4 Write a Java program for pass-II of a two-pass macro-processor. The output of assignment-3 (MNT, MDT and file without any macro definitions) should be input for this assignment.



#Group B Based on LEX and YACC
1 Write a program to create Dynamic Link Library for any mathematical operation and write an application program to test it. (Java Native Interface / Use VB or VC++).

2. Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of compiler to generate tokens of subset of Java program.

3 Write a program using Lex specifications to implement lexical analysis phase of compiler to count no. of words,lines and characters of given input file.

4 Write a program using YACC specifications to implement syntax analysis phase of compiler to validate type and syntax of variable declaration in Java.


5 Write a program using YACC specifications to implement syntax analysis phase of compiler to recognize simple and compound sentences given in input
file.

#Group C Based on process management (OS)
1. Write a Java program (using OOP features) to implement following scheduling algorithms:
FCFS , SJF (Preemptive), Priority (Non-Preemptive) and Round Robin (Preemptive)

2. Write a Java program to implement Bankerâ€˜s Algorithm 19/03/2018


3. Implement UNIX system calls like ps, fork, join, exec family, and wait for process management (use shell script/ Java/ C programming).

4. Study assignment on process scheduling algorithms in Android and Tizen.

#Group D Based on memory management (OS)
1. Write a Java Program (using OOP features) to implement paging simulation using
  1. Least Recently Used (LRU)
  2. Optimal algorithm
